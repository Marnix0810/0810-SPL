# The 0810[^1] simple and permissive license

[^1]: The license name has been changed because of the small changes that are described [here](#Not-Open-Source). Also the license's publisher is no longer 0810 Software but me personally (<a href="https://github.com/Marnix0810">@Marnix0810</a>).

0810 Software creates open-source-software, to empower the  open-source-software developing community we are creating our own  [~~open-source-~~](#Not-Open-Source)software license. ‘The 0810 Software simple and permissive  [~~open source~~](#Not-Open-Source) license (rev. 1.0)’ is our first self-created license and we are proud to anounce that you are now free to use it to license your  own [~~open-source-~~](#Not-Open-Source)software (you will need to change “[licensor]” with your own, company or repository owner’s name!).

## Important: Not really open source
<a name="Not-Open-Source"></a>

After trying to register it to SPDX, I received the comment it shouldn't be called open source because it doesn't allow selling the software or code without altering it first. Also they complained about the fact that other open source licenses could also be used because there are already a whole lot.
